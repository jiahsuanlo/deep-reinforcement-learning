    "# Deep Reinforcement Learning - Project 1 Naviagtion\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: JiaHsuan Lo\n",
    "\n",
    "Date: 2019-0506\n",
    "\n",
    "This report describes the first project of Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning NanoDegree. \n",
    "The Unity ML-Agents Banana environment is used in the project. The simulation contains a \n",
    "single agent that navigates a large environment. At each time step, it has four actions at \n",
    "its disposal, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 - walk forward \n",
    "- 1 - walk backward\n",
    "- 2 - turn left\n",
    "- 3 - turn right\n",
    "\n",
    "The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based \n",
    "perception of objects around agent's forward direction. A reward of +1 is provided for \n",
    "collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to implement and train a deep reinforcment learning agent\n",
    "to maximize the reward.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A deep Q-learning network (DQN) algorithm was used in this project. A simple fully-connected \n",
    "neuro-net architecture was applied to both the local and target networks. Experience replay \n",
    "was also used to improve the learning performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q-Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the target and local networks use the same architecture, which is listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a 64-node fully-connected hidden layer\n",
    "- a relu layer\n",
    "- a 64-node fully-connected hidden layer\n",
    "- a relu layer\n",
    "- an output layer \n",
    "\n",
    "The soft-update scheme was used for updating the parameters of the target network. A update \n",
    "constant `tau`=0.001 was used, and the updating formula is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "target_net_parameter= tau * local_net_parameter + (1 - tau)*target_net_parameter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The episode time span was set at 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experience Replay\n",
    "\n",
    "An experience replay buffer with a size of 1e5 was used. The sampling method is random\n",
    "sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Plot of Rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the reward history plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Reward History](ScoreHistory.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that a basic DQN setup with a simple two-layer fully-connected network \n",
    "architecture and a random-sampling replay buffer performs adequately to achieve the project\n",
    "goal. The algorithm converges to a score of 13.00 within 447 episodes of training. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve the learning speed, several possible ideas may be helpful:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Double DQN architecture: Using two DQN networks to determine the TD target can avoid the over-\n",
    "  estimation of Q-value problem. \n",
    "- Proritized experience replay sampling: By setting the TD error as the sampling probability,\n",
    "  the samples with more room of improvement are more likely to be selected. This may lead to \n",
    "  better learning efficiency."
